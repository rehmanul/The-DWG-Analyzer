Question: share a plan: if we want to process cad dxf/dwg/pdf files and identify the actual floor plan into it, after identifying actual floor plan then process it with below segment and attached image like pixel perfect as same as the image
it will be 2D visual

first take the real floor plan into the file

process it as same design in image we expecting to have
visual ready
then we place ilots
share visual and other details as shared attached 2nd image

then corridor visual as shared 3rd image

tell me is that possible, if possible then what will be the detailed steps to implement a full ready thing.

no need to implement just share a full plan.
Answer: Yes, this is absolutely possible! Your CAD Analyzer Pro project already has most of the infrastructure needed. Let me share a detailed implementation plan based on your images.

Detailed Implementation Plan for Pixel-Perfect CAD Floor Plan Processing
Based on your images, here's a comprehensive plan to achieve exactly what you want:

Phase 1: CAD File Processing & Floor Plan Extraction
Step 1.1: Enhanced DXF/DWG/PDF Parser

Upgrade the existing UltraHighPerformanceAnalyzer to handle complex multi-sheet CAD files
Implement smart floor plan detection to identify the main architectural drawing among multiple views
Add layer-based extraction to separate walls, dimensions, annotations, and furniture
Step 1.2: Geometric Element Recognition

Wall detection with proper thickness and connectivity
Door/window opening identification with swing directions
Room boundary detection and labeling
Automatic scaling and unit conversion
Phase 2: Pixel-Perfect Visual Matching (Image 1 - Empty Plan)
Step 2.1: Exact Visual Reproduction

Create walls as thick gray lines (MUR) matching your reference
Implement blue restricted areas (NO ENTREE) with proper positioning
Add red entrance/exit zones (ENTRÉE/SORTIE) with curved door swings
Perfect color matching: Gray (#6B7280), Blue (#3B82F6), Red (#EF4444)
Step 2.2: Professional Drawing Standards

Clean architectural line weights and styles
Proper room spacing and proportions
Accurate geometric relationships between elements
Phase 3: Intelligent Îlot Placement (Image 2)
Step 3.1: Advanced Room Analysis

Calculate usable floor area excluding restricted zones
Identify optimal furniture placement zones
Consider clearance requirements and accessibility
Step 3.2: Smart Îlot Distribution

Generate different sized rectangles (small, medium, large îlots)
Optimize placement for maximum space utilization
Ensure proper spacing between îlots
Color-code by size categories (light pink/red outlines as shown)
Phase 4: Corridor Network Generation (Image 3)
Step 4.1: Pathfinding Algorithm

Connect all îlots with optimal corridor paths
Minimize total corridor length while ensuring accessibility
Add area measurements for each îlot (as shown: 5.50m², 7.50m², etc.)
Step 4.2: Professional Visualization

Pink/red corridor lines connecting îlots
Area labels with precise measurements
Maintain visual hierarchy (walls, îlots, corridors, text)

# üèóÔ∏è AI √élot Placement PRO - User Guide

## Client Requirements Implementation

### ‚úÖ Features Implemented

1. **Zone Detection by Color**
   - Black lines (color 7/0): Walls - √Ælots can touch these
   - Light blue areas (color 5): Restricted zones (stairs, elevators) - avoided
   - Red areas (color 1): Entrances/exits - buffer zones applied

2. **Proportional √élot Placement**
   - 0-1m¬≤ √Ælots: Small utilities, storage
   - 1-3m¬≤ √Ælots: Bathrooms, closets
   - 3-5m¬≤ √Ælots: Standard rooms
   - 5-10m¬≤ √Ælots: Suites, common areas

3. **Automatic Corridor Generation**
   - Corridors placed between facing √Ælot rows
   - Configurable width (80-200cm)
   - No overlap with √Ælots
   - Connects all √Ælot groups

4. **Constraint Compliance**
   - Avoids red and blue zones
   - Allows √Ælots to touch walls
   - Maintains minimum clearances
   - Optimizes space utilization

## How to Use

### 1. Launch Application
```bash
# Run main application
streamlit run apps/streamlit_app.py

# Or run dedicated √Ælot app
python run_ilot_placement.py
```

### 2. Upload DXF File
- Upload your architectural plan in DXF format
- Ensure color coding: Black=walls, Blue=restricted, Red=entrances

### 3. Configure √élot Distribution
- Set percentages for each size category
- Total must equal 100%
- Adjust total number of √Ælots
- Set corridor width

### 4. Generate Layout
- Click "Generate √élot Layout"
- View results with color-coded √Ælots
- Check placement metrics

### 5. Export Results
- Download DXF file with √Ælots and corridors
- Export JSON report with metrics
- Professional CAD-compatible output

## Expected Output

The system generates:
- **Colored √Ælots** by size category
- **Orange corridors** between rows
- **Placement metrics** (success rate, utilization)
- **Professional exports** (DXF, reports)

## Example Hotel Configuration

```
10% of √Ælots between 0 and 1 m¬≤   (utilities)
25% of √Ælots between 1 and 3 m¬≤   (bathrooms)  
30% of √Ælots between 3 and 5 m¬≤   (standard rooms)
35% of √Ælots between 5 and 10 m¬≤  (suites)
```

## Technical Notes

- Uses advanced geometric algorithms
- Shapely library for spatial operations
- Genetic optimization for placement
- Real-time constraint checking
- Professional visualization with Plotly

## Troubleshooting

**No √Ælots placed?**
- Check DXF color coding
- Ensure sufficient space
- Reduce √Ælot count or size

**Missing corridors?**
- Need multiple √Ælot rows
- Check corridor width setting
- Verify √Ælot spacing

**Export issues?**
- Ensure ezdxf library installed
- Check file permissions
- Try different export format

## Integration

The √Ælot placement is fully integrated into the main AI Architectural Analyzer:
- Available in both Standard and Advanced modes
- Works with existing DWG/DXF parsing
- Compatible with all export functions
- Includes professional reporting
